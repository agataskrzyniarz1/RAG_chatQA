    {
        "question": "What factors influence the choice of noun endings in Polish?",
        "ground_truth": "The choice of endings is influenced by phonetic factors (such as whether the noun stem ends in a hard or soft consonant, or a vowel) as well as semantic factors (such as the category of animacy, inanimacy, and personal vs. non-personal reference within the masculine gender) (Bartnicka, 1990)."

    },
    {
        "question": "Why is CER considered a better metric than WER for evaluating interlanguage transcription?",
        "ground_truth": "CER provides a more fine-grained perspective because even partially correct transcriptions are rewarded for character-level similarity, and it better reflects the degree to which ASR output preserves traces of the learner's original production (K et al., 2024)."

    {
        "question": "Why were pronunciation errors indicated through Polish spelling rather than IPA?",
        "ground_truth": "The reasons were:\n1. Manual transcription is time-consuming and annotation rules should be simple and intuitive\n2. Full phonemic transcription would have substantially reduced corpus size\n3. Standard orthographic transcription facilitates processing by automated tools like lemmatization and POS tagging\n4.

        "ground_truth": "The nominative case was most overused by learners, with 941.67% more produced cases than expected, as the nominative is the default case in Polish and learners overgeneralize when lacking explicit declension knowledge."

        "ground_truth": "Italian learners tended to replace the nasal vowel /ɔ̃w̃/ in niską /ɲiskɔ̃w̃/ with the sequence /ɔn/, producing forms such as niskon, illustrating the difficulty of acquiring nasal vowels absent from their native phonological system."

        "question": "What did El Ayari and Li (2024) find when evaluating Whisper on French L2 learner corpus?",
        "ground_truth": "El Ayari and Li (2024) found that although Whisper achieved relatively good WER and CER scores on advanced learners, it often hyper-normalized learner speech by correcting errors, introducing hallucinations, or omitting disfluencies such as repetitions and pauses."

        "question": "What early CAPT system was developed specifically for German learners of Polish?",
        "ground_truth": "AzAR was an early Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training system developed specifically for German learners, combining HMM-based ASR with error patterns typical of L2 Polish (Wagner, 2010)."

    },
    {
        "question": "Why is overcorrection by ASR systems problematic for interlanguage research?",
        "ground_truth": "Overcorrection is problematic because it obscures the learner's original production, and deviations from the target norm are precisely the phenomena under investigation in second language acquisition research."
    },
    {
        "question": "What suggestion is made for future improvement of Whisper for interlanguage transcription?",
        "ground_truth": "One promising direction is fine-tuning Whisper using a dedicated interlanguage corpus, training the system to recognize and transcribe interlanguage forms rather than correcting them into standard Polish."

        "question": "Which learner group showed the highest CER scores according to the analysis?",
        "ground_truth": "Italian and British learners showed the highest CERs (above 60%), while Dutch learners achieved the lowest (27%), likely due to clearer articulation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the thesis conclude about the relationship between case-related errors and learners' native languages?",
        "ground_truth": "The thesis concludes that case-related errors are not strongly dependent on the learners' native language and instead reflect universal developmental patterns and the inherent complexity of the Polish case system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What conclusions does the thesis draw about pronunciation errors and native language influence?",
        "ground_truth": "While specific realizations vary across learners' native languages, clear tendencies can be observed for different language groups, suggesting that learners often substitute unfamiliar Polish sounds with more familiar ones from their L1."
    },
    {
        "question": "What were the most frequently required grammatical cases in the Route Direction task?",
        "ground_truth": "The most frequently required cases were the genitive (used for possession and after prepositions like obok) and instrumental (used when describing movement along a path and after the preposition za)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What challenge does the Polish case system pose for spaCy's automatic analysis?",
        "ground_truth": "The Polish case system is highly complex because a single inflected form may correspond to multiple cases, and accurately identifying the correct case often requires considering the broader syntactic context of the word within the sentence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What percentage of interlanguage words in the pronunciation subcorpus were invented by Whisper?",
        "ground_truth": "Whisper produced entirely new words (hallucinations) in 108 cases, representing 16.31% of the pronunciation-related interlanguage corpus."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many non-Polish transcriptions were generated by Whisper due to hallucinations?",
        "ground_truth": "Out of 89 examples, 15 were generated in a language other than Polish, caused by the highly distorted nature of the interlanguage and rare instances where learners briefly switched to their native language."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is input in the context of second language acquisition research?",
        "ground_truth": "In second language acquisition research, input refers to the language learners are exposed to in the target language, which provides the primary source of linguistic data for developing their interlanguage system."
    },
    {
        "question": "What limitation was found with using langdetect for identifying non-Polish words in the learner corpus?",
        "ground_truth": "The automatic language detection method was unreliable because many simplified interlanguage words were incorrectly classified as belonging to other languages, as they were deformed attempts at Polish words rather than actual foreign language words."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is described as a key question in designing an ASR system for interlanguage?",
        "ground_truth": "A key question is whether the system should be tailored to learners of a specific native language or whether a more general model would suffice, since speakers of different native languages often exhibit consistent error patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What dual-model system is proposed for future language learning applications?",
        "ground_truth": "A dual-model system is proposed where one model faithfully reproduces the learner's interlanguage (showing exactly what the learner said) while a second model provides the corrected standard version, allowing learners to compare their productions with target forms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the 42% faithful reproduction rate for declension errors?",
        "ground_truth": "While the 42% faithful reproduction rate for declension errors is notably higher than for pronunciation errors (10.88%), it is still considered insufficient, indicating that improvements are needed to better capture case-related deviations."
